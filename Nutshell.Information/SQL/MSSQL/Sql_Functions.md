Sql Function https://medium.com/codestorm/stored-procedure-vs-function-1011a23bd8b1
Functions improve the performance and efficiency of the database. SQL functions are compiled and cached before use. Complex programming logic can be decomposed into a number of smaller and simpler functions, thus making it easier to understand and maintain.
*A function is compiled and executed every time whenever it is called. A function must return a value and cannot modify the data received as parameters.
