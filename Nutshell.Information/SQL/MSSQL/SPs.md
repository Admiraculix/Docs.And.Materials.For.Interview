A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

Stored Procedure in SQL allows us to create SQL queries to be stored and executed on the server. Stored procedures can also be cached and reused. The main purpose of stored procedures is to hide direct SQL queries from the code and improve the performance of database operations such as select, update, and delete data.

*Stored Procedures are pre-compiled objects which are compiled for the first time and their compiled format is saved, which executes (compiled code) whenever it is called.*
