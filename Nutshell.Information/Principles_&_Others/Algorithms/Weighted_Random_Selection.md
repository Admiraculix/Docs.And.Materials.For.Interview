Random weighted selection is a process of choosing an item from a collection of items based on their individual weights. Each item's weight determines its likelihood of being selected. Items with higher weights have a greater chance of being chosen compared to items with lower weights.

In essence, this algorithm simulates throwing a dart at a number line that is divided into segments proportional to the probabilities of the symbols. Where the dart lands determines the selected symbol. Symbols with higher probabilities occupy larger segments of the number line, making them more likely to be selected.

The algorithm simulates selecting an item from a collection of items, where each item has a probability associated with it. The cumulative probabilities of the items are calculated, creating ranges on a virtual number line. When a random value is generated, the algorithm checks which range that value falls into and selects the corresponding item.

For example, if you have three items with probabilities [10, 30, 60 ], the algorithm would create ranges [1, 10], [11, 40], and [41, 100]. These ranges represent the cumulative probabilities. When a random value is generated between 1 and 100, the algorithm would determine which range the value falls into and select the corresponding item.
