MassTransit is an open-source distributed application framework for .NET that provides a consistent abstraction on top of the supported message transports. The interfaces provided by MassTransit reduce message-based application complexity and allow developers to focus their effort on adding business value

*Message Routing -> Type-based publish/subscribe and automatic broker topology configuration
*Exception Handling -> When an exception is thrown, messages can be retried, redelivered, or moved to an error queue
*Test Harness -> Fast, in-memory unit tests with consumed, published, and sent message observers
*Observability -> Native Open Telemetry (OTEL) support for end-to-end activity tracing
*Dependency Injection -> Service collection configuration and scope service provider management
*Scheduling -> Schedule message delivery using transport delay, Quartz.NET, and Hangfire
*Sagas, State Machines -> Reliable, durable, event-driven workflow orchestration
*Routing Slip Activities -> Distributed, fault-tolerant transaction choreography with compensation
*Request, Response -> Handle requests with fast, automatic response routing
