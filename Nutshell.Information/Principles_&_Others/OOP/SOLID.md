- [b] Link: https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/single-responsibility-principle/

• **The Single-responsibility principle:** 
	"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
	SRP -> representation of [S]OLID 

• **The Open–closed principle:** 
	"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
	OCP -> representation of S[O]LID 

• **The Liskov substitution principle:** 
	-> "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
	-> LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. In other words, what we want is to have the objects of our subclasses behaving the same way as the objects of our superclass.
	LSP -> representation of SO[L]ID 

• **The Interface segregation principle:** 
	"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
	ISP -> representation of SOL[I]D 

•The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
	DIP -> is representation of SOLI[D] and also is Dependency Injection
