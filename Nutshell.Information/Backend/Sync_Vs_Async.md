Sync vs async (long-running operations) 
-The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include:
Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel.
Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server.
Async increases throughput because multiple operations can run at the same time.
Sync is single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.
Sync is blocking â€” it will only send the server one request at a time and will wait for that request to be answered by the server.
Sync is slower and more methodical.

 - asynchronous execution is suitable to avoid blocking the main thread.
